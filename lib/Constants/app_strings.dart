    "Notesbank does not require users to create an account, log in, or provide any personal information to use the app. As such, we do not collect, store, or process any personal data on our servers.",
    "Users can optionally set a profile image, name, and phone number in the app’s drawer section. This information is not uploaded or stored on any external server. It is stored locally on the user’s device and is only visible to the user. Notesbank has no access to this information.",
    "The PDFs of handwritten notes uploaded by the developer are made available for users to view. Users cannot upload or edit content within the app. These PDFs are organized by subject, year, and faculty and are solely for reading purposes.",
    "Since Notesbank does not implement login or signup features, there is no authentication process. All app features are accessible without any need for user validation.",
    "Notesbank does not share, sell, or distribute any information provided by the user (such as profile image or name) with third parties, as this data is stored locally and never reaches our servers or any third-party services.",
    "Notesbank does not use any analytics or tracking tools to monitor user activity within the app. As such, we do not collect data on app usage, user interactions, or user preferences.",
    "The app uses local storage (device storage) to save profile information and to enable offline access to the notes. This data remains on the user’s device and is not synced or shared with any external systems.",
    "Since all profile information is stored locally on your device and never transmitted over the internet, we do not handle data security for this information. Users are responsible for securing their devices to prevent unauthorized access to any locally stored information.",
    "Notesbank does not contain external links or advertisements that may direct users to third-party websites or services.",
    "This privacy policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be reflected within the app, and users are encouraged to review the policy periodically.",
